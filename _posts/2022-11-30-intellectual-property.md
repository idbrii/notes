New game makers often have questions about trademarks, copyright, and likeness
rights (like making a game around someone else's IP). IP questions are either
answered by basic IP knowledge or something you should ask a lawyer about.

To address that first part, The Practical Law GDC talk series isn't too dry, is
gamedev-focused, and gives you a decent grounding in relevant IP law:

These talks are US-focused, but globally relevant due to international IP agreements.
