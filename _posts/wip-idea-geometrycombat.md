# Geometry Combat

Inspired by [Patrick writing about Paper Mario The Origami King](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/jgxdyy/paper-mario-the-origami-king-has-exposed-my-broken-brain)
(where combat is based on geometry, but interaction is repositioning rings and
segments on concentric circles), this idea is about combining different attacks
that compose based on their geometry.

Could be interesting as a combat system in a light RPG.

* Each attack has a defined shape.
* Choose multiple attacks and place them without overlapping.
* Want to optimize number of hits: place shapes to cover as many enemies with your attack.
* Similar to a tangram puzzle.
* Some attacks have knockback to push enemies around on the board.
* Board is a grid. Enemies occupy cells in the grid.
