wolfsbane
=========

A barely-started werewolf detective game.


# Motivation

You arrive in a town after a string of grisly deaths. Everybody's afraid of some big bad animal tearing through livestock. When people start dying, some yahoo starts getting everyone superstitious and telling people it's a werewolf. Turns out, you're a werewolf and don't appreciate slander against your kind.

You're a werewolf. You're not a bad guy. You're a detective.

There's a town of people who go about their daily lives. If they see you transform, they'll bring a posse with pitchforks and torches after you and it's game over.

Someone's killing the townspeople and it looks like a large animal. They're getting superstitious and think it's a werewolf. You want to solve the murder to avoid suspicion.


Human Form
==========

You can run and carry two weapons (probably melee only: wooden club, sharpened stick, large stone, etc).

You're not very fast but can grab, swing, climb.

You can interact with objects with your hands.

You're not very good at combat. Mostly enough to try to escape.

You can change into a wolf at will.

If it's a full moon, you're forced to change into a wolf.

Changing to a wolf drops your items and damages your clothes.


Wolf Form
=========

You're a four-legged wolf. You're smaller than humans.

You have constant hunger. You need to feed or you'll die.

So long as it's not a full moon, you can change back to human.

You are agile, and can run and jump great distances. Keep the right rhythm and you can build up great speed.

At top speed, you're bounding and need to jump immediately after landing to maintain speed.

You have powerful jaws and can bite to attack. When you bite, shake back and forth to inflict damage on your victim (like Depth).

Could be similar to the monster gameplay from Evolve? Run around, occasionally pouncing on wildlife to keep your hunger in check, quickly moving to your destination. Also very powerful in combat, but at risk of becoming weak due to hunger.


Gameplay
========

Snoop around town as human to find leads on murders. Travel to forest regions to find evidence. Fend off bandits and region bosses as a wolf.

Drop stashes around the world to use when you become human again. Otherwise you'll be weaponless (aside from what you can scavenge).

Eventually, you discover that it's vampires that are attacking the villagers. You need to travel to their crypts and vanquish them. Fight them as wolf to weaken them and vanquish as human with a wooden stake (sharpened stick).


Combat Loop
===========

All melee combat. All melee enemies.

Become wolf. Use agility to get behind enemy and bite. Running, jumping, like Hot Lava.

Use bite attacks to neck deal damage.

Use bite attacks to legs injure and reduce enemy ability to keep up with agility.

Use bite attacks to arms injure and reduce enemy ability to attack.

Enemy jab attacks come from their block stance. These are punishment for getting too close. Back up and make them use sweeps. Parrying jabs avoids damage but causes knockback to player.

Enemy sweep attacks have windup tells that indicate direction of attack sweep. Run into sweep and hit parry with good timing to avoid the hit and daze enemy. (Running under their arms.)


Core Loop
=========

Snoop on gossip in town to learn about dungeons.

Run dungeon: forest glade where beast is believed to live, abandoned mine where hermit lives who saw the beast, family of hunter who was killed by beast, farm where beast attacked cattle.

Dungeons elements:
* recon - find evidence collectibles
* combat - defend against ambushes; ambush known hostiles
* puzzle - backtrack from obvious starting point (how attack happened); trigger A, B, C to gain entry into locked area
* stealth - avoid combat with distractions; minimal

Locomotion should be enjoyable as wolf. Running through a lot of the same world to get to different locations, so movement itself should feel good.
