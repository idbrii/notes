# [The Physics of Fun: The Vehicles of Saints Row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XXw-2EPlL0)
seems like a good talker
* Havok vehicles are simulations. tons of interconnected variables; hard to tune. my takeaway: overcomplicated. avoid if possible.
* use math to understand how tuning values should affect feel. (gear ratio in terms of acceleration)
    * helps with understanding how to tune havok and for coming up with tuning values for an arcadey vehicle.
* lie to havok to decouple assets from vehicle handling.
* Lots of thoughts here for teams making lots of vehicles.

# [Supercharged! Vehicle Physics in Skylanders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db1AgGavL8E)

# [It IS Rocket Science! The Physics of Rocket League Detailed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEmiDM94IE)
seems like a boring talker

# [The Science of Off-Roading: Uncharted 4's 4x4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKXqWcaoTGE)
starts out not too comfortable and too rehearsed

# [Vehicle Feel Masterclass: Balancing Arcade Accessibility with Simulation Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_A0RqeGado)
Criterion. Seems like a good talker if a little monotone/rehearsed.
