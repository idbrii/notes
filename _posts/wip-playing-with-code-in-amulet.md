How do we talk to computers?

We don't use French or Mandarin or English.

We use a programming language. 

Lua is a programming language.

It's what I use at work.

We're going to mess around with some code today to discover some aspects of
programming. We're going to use a tool called Amulet and write some Lua code.

First, open [the Amulet Editor][amulet-editor]. Next, delete everything in the
left hand side (`local win blah blah`). Finally, copy this code and paste it
into the left hand side:

{% gist 6389c10c07733ad0e1b0af135bdf8864 amulet.lua %}

There's a section at the top with some code for us to look at. For now, don't
worry about everything after `amulet details`.

Let's look at the code and see what we can change.

## Learning Through Play with Code Combat

There's a game you can play by writing code to control your hero. It's like the
Scratch examples, but you have the choice of several real programming
languages. Python and Lua are commonly used in game development. It's called
[Code Combat][codecombat].

You can play Code Combat for free on BPL, but they have a $10/month
subscription that gets you more levels. I think once he's finished with the
first 80 free levels, he'd be ready to move on to making his own games instead.
To stick on the free track, skip the levels that ask for a subscription (the
blue stars).

## Visual Programming with Scratch

You've already done some visual programming in ScratchJr, but there's also a
lot more you can do with [Scratch on the web][scratch]. You can make games and
stories; try out other people's creations; and even see how their creations
work.

## A Programming Lesson Plan

Khan Academy has a big interactive traditional programming syllabus and has an
[Hour of
Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-code-lessons/hour-of-drawing-code/v/welcome-hour-of-code)
with lessons and challenges. The lessons try to explain how to think about
writing your code instead of just copying the teacher. They're more advanced
and use JavaScript which is a commonly used programming language that's similar
to Lua. 

Khan Academy also has a [parent's
section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-code-for-teachers/a/using-hour-of-code-with-your-child)
to help your parents understand what it's all about.
